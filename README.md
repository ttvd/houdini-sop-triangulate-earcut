[Houdini](http://www.sidefx.com/index.php) HDK SOP node which triangulates points using a Mapbox Earcut library.

## More info
[Mapbox Earcut](https://github.com/mapbox/earcut.hpp)
[FIST: Fast Industrial-Strength Triangulation of Polygons](http://www.cosy.sbg.ac.at/~held/projects/triang/triang.html) by Martin Held [ [Triangulation by Ear Clipping](http://www.geometrictools.com/Documentation/TriangulationByEarClipping.pdf) by David Eberly.

## Binaries, Houdini 16.0
* [Windows, Houdini 16.0.557](https://github.com/ttvd/houdini-sop-triangulate-earcut/releases/download/1.0/SOP_TriangulateEarCut.16.0.557.Win64.rar) 

## Building

* Tested on Windows and Houdini 16.0.
  * You would have to patch CMake file to get this building on Linux.
* Define HOUDINI_VERSION env variable to be the version of Houdini 15.5 you wish to build against (for example "15.5.607").
* Alternatively, you can have HFS env variable defined (set when you source houdini_setup).
* Generate build files from CMake for your favorite build system. For Windows builds use MSVC 2015.
* Build the ROP Houdini dso (SOP_TriangulateEarCut.dylib or SOP_TriangulateEarCut.dll).
* Place the dso in the appropriate Houdini dso folder.
  * On OS X this would be /Users/your_username/Library/Preferences/houdini/16.0/dso/
  * On Windows this would be C:\Users\your_username\Documents\houdini16.0\dso

## Usage

* Place the SOP into your SOP network.
* Connect input geometry to triangulate.

## Other

* This plugin uses [earcut.hpp library](https://github.com/mapbox/earcut.hpp) to triangulate points.
